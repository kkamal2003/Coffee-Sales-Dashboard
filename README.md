# Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **Coffee Sales Dashboard** is a project designed to analyze and visualize coffee sales data. Using Excel, we integrated data from three sheets—`Orders`, `Customers`, and `Products`—to create an enriched dataset. The project highlights sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance through pivot tables and an interactive dashboard.
